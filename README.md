  <br/>

The Working of app solely depends on API to get realtime data.<br/>
API - https://api.covid19india.org/<br/><br/>
There are few changes in there API which takes place regularly<br/>
Which may lead to small impact on My dash app<br/>
I would not suggest you go through covid19india.org's CSV (DATASET) or JSON because it contains lots of unwanted data and does not contain longitude & latitude  on Each District.<br/>
If you prefer that please edit the json and remove unwanted DATA.<br/>
So plz check my COVID19_TRACKER repository for more info.<br/>
json link-https://api.covid19india.org/state_district_wise.json<br/>
cvs link-https://api.covid19india.org/documentation/csv/<br/>
My CSV FILE -https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-QseMOhwLVCbijjO2mcMc_xXL3Bd2rM8/view?usp=sharing<br/>
The above file is updated every day 1-2 pm.<br/>
